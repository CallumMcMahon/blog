After being a lurker on the web for the longest time, I plan to contribute back.

Some aspirational aims to come out of this process:
- Contributing to open source projects
- Spark discussions around existing projects that I've made
- Showcase tech that I'm currently excited about
- Share explanations that click with my brain, where existing material don't

Ideally I'll be doing a mix of micro-blogging most weekends, as well as occasional 
larger pieces ever few months.

### Why now
After working in a corporate setting for 4.5 years where producing content online was 
actively discouraged, I'm exercising some of my new freedom! 
Also, having a public-facing presence can have its benefits.
